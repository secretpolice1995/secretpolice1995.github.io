My name is Taihua Shao. I am a Grade 1 PhD student at the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), Changsha, China, with a major on Information System.

During the master's period, my research topic mainly focuses on natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR). I have conducted research on question-answering (QA), or more specifically, answer selection in QA. My recent research interest involves Question Answering, Dialogue System as well as Conversational Recommendation.
